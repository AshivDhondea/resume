## Research projects
- **DFTS2: Deep Feature Transmission Simulator version 2** and **CALTeC: Content-Adaptive Linear Tensor Completion for collaborative intelligence**
  - Collaborative Intelligence is a hybrid AI deployment strategy: it involves splitting a deep neural network model into two sub-models. The first sub-model runs on a device with limited computational power such as a mobile phone. The second sub-model runs on a remote cloud service, with comparatively large computing power. By leveraging both types of compute resources, collaborative intelligence leads to reduced latency and increased energy savings as compared to single-resource deployment strategies. A deep feature tensor is transmitted over an imperfect communication channel from the device to the cloud. Due to the lossy nature of the communication channel, there may be lost or corrupted packets in the tensor received at the cloud. Potential applications of CI include Internet of Things services, autonomous naviagation and point of care services. These applications may involve a lossy communication channel. To understand the impact of lossy channels in collaborative intelligence applications, a simulator named DFTS was developed. DFTS stands for Deep Feature TRansmission S. I modified DFTS to become compatible with TensorFlow version 2. Furthermore, this updated DFTS has sophisticated features:
    - additional communication channel models and simulation modes.
    - tensor packet recovery methods from the recent literature.
  - DFTS2 can be cloned from this [repo](https://github.com/AshivDhondea/DFTS2). I also provide packet traces, experiment files, example yml scripts to replicate experiments published in my ICIP 2021 and VCIP 2021 papers.

- **SORADSIM: Space Object RADar SIMulator**
  - Orbital debris, also called space junk or space debris, consist of artificial objects such as spent rocket stages, inoperative satellites, lost pieces of equipment and fragments from past collisions and explosions in Earth orbit. Space debris pose an extremely concerning collision threat to Manâ€™s valuable spacecraft in orbit: not only can a piece of space rubble collide with a spacecraft at a very high relative velocity and put it out of commission, it can also collide with another piece of junk, thereby creating a
multitude of smaller particles which eventually spread out in orbit and increase the chances of collision with an important space asset. The rising uncertainty in the safety of the space environment in the early 2000s led to the emergence of the concept of Space Situational Awareness (SSA). SSA is defined as the thorough knowledge of the space environment, which incorporates the ability to track and predict the location of space objects (RSOs) at any time. In order to very accurately track space debris, it is necessary to obtain position and/or velocity measurements as often as possible and covering as much of the RSOs' orbits as possible. This motivated the interest of the Radar Remote Sensing Group at the University of Cape Town to study potentially observing and tracking space debris by using the South African MeerKAT radio telescope instrument as radar receiver. In the envisaged bistatic radar configuration, the radar transmitter would be located at a missile test range in western South Africa. My master's project was concerned with developing a Mission Planning Tool in Python to
      - predict when a particular space debris would be observable by the proposed bistatic radar system, 
      - simulate the space debris trajectory
      - simulate the radar measurements including th

## Self-study projects

. - **Python implementation of MATLAB simulations for radar systems design**

.. - I studied extensively from the book "MATLAB simulations for radar systems design" over the years. I do not have access to MATLAB anymore, so I thought that I could implement the same methods in Python to assist those who, like me, do not have access to a MATLAB license.

. - **Python Target Tracking Toolbox**
.. -I developed a Python toolbox for target tracking experiments. The intention behind it is to be a learning tool, not a library that can be used in production code. So the coding approach is very simplistic and aims to demonstrate the inner mechanics of target tracking algorithms.
