## Education
- **Simon Fraser University**. Burnaby, BC, Canada. 2020-2021
. - MEng in Engineering Science. Coursework focused on deep learning, communication networks, computer vision, and renewable energy systems. My MEng project was in multimedia signal processing and AI deployment. I developed a tensor completion method for collaborative intelligence and successfully published it in a conference paper at ICIP 2021 in Anchorage, Alaska. I developed a more sophisticated version of a framework for collaborative intelligence experiments and published a conference paper on it at VCIP 2021 in Munich, Germany.

- **University of Cape Town**. Cape Town, South Africa. 2015-2017
. - MSc(Eng) in Electrical Engineering. Fully-funded research masters in radar systems engineering and radio astronomy. I developed a Python-based Mission Planning Tool for scheduling space debris observation and tracking experiments with a bistatic radar. I successfully published a paper on my work at an IEEE Radar conference in Boston, Massachussetts.

- **University of Cape Town**. Cape Town, South Africa. 2011-2014
. - BSc(Eng) *Hons* in Electrical Engineering. Undergraduate degree with a strong focus on digital signal processing, control systems, wireless communication networks and medical image processing. My undergraduate thesis was in image processing.

## Work experience
- **Graduate electrical engineer** at **GIBB (Mauritius)** (consulting engineering), 2018-2019.
. - I conducted electrical surveys at an oil bunkering plant, gathered power flow meter data at major distribution cabinets, and developed Python scripts to post-process the measured data for power flow studies. I worked with colleagues to analyze the recorded data and to come up with strategies to improve power factor, reduce total harmonic distortion, mitigate cable losses and facilitate the operation and control of various pumping stations. My main contributions were to collect and post-process the data, to determine the main characteristics of the plant's electrical load, to establish the existing electrical layout and to develop improved proposed electrical layouts. Our report was well-appreciated
